### Brief project description

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of electricity demand forecasting in New South Wales (NSW) using time-series modelling techniques. We utilized datasets spanning from January 2010 to March 2021, which include half-hourly electricity demand and temperature data, to develop and compare several forecasting models. The focus was on evaluating Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models enhanced with Fourier terms and exogenous variables such as Temperature. The methodology and outcomes from this study are thoroughly documented to facilitate replication and further research in this vital area of energy economics.
